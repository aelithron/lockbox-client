# lockbox-client
Official client for `The Lockbox`, an encrypted and private platform for dropping messages. \
Note that the server is at [lockbox-server](https://github.com/aelithron/lockbox-server).\
I'm building this for Hack Club's Siege event!
## Inspiration
This exists because of one key problem: I often think of things I want to tell my therapist while I'm at school, and can't check my phone to add them to a note. If I sign in to a notes app on the Chromebook, the district spyware (Securly) would read all of my notes. Also, I have a terrible memory D: \
A system like this allows me to add notes without exposing the existing ones to the device, and with much higher privacy and security, thus why I built it!
## Features
- Anonymity (works through public and private keys)
- Drop from anywhere, view from anywhere else later
## Using
**The app isn't done yet!**
1. Open the client on a secure device (personally-owned, with HTTPS and a secure Wi-Fi network).
2. Click the `Create a box` button, and confirm.
3. Save the keys it gives you in a safe place. **WARNING:** If you lose the unlock key, your vault is unrecoverable. You can always retrieve the drop key with the unlock key, though.
4. Try dropping a note into your new box!
